ToDo List Project
The ToDo List project is a web application developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, and Body-Parser. It is designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks by providing a simple and easy-to-use interface.

Installation:

To use the ToDo List project, follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS and npm on your system, if they are not already installed. You can download NodeJS from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required modules by running the following command:
npm install express body-parser ejs

This will install the ExpressJS, Body-Parser, and EJS modules required for the project.

4. Once the modules are installed, start the server by running the following command:
node app.js

5. The server will start running on localhost:3000. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the ToDo List project.

That's it! You are now ready to use the ToDo List project on your system.

Usage:

Once the server is started and you open the localhost:3000, you will see the main page. The main page displays the current day, month, and date, and a ToDo list with 3 initial items as examples. You can mark an item as done by clicking on the box next to it. To add a new item to the list, type your new item in the input field below the initial items and click on the "+" button.

You can also navigate to http://localhost:3000/work to see the Work ToDo list page. This page works in the same way as the main page, allowing you to add, delete and mark items as done.

The application also features an About page, which can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/about. This page provides some general information about the project and its features.

All the pages in the project are designed using EJS and have a consistent design style.

Conclusion:

The ToDo List project is a simple and effective way to keep track of your daily tasks. It is easy to use and can help you stay organized and focused. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
