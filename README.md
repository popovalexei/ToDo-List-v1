Upon launching the server and accessing http://localhost:3000, you will encounter the main page, displaying the current date along with an initial ToDo list featuring three sample items. To mark an item as complete, simply click the checkbox beside it. Adding a new item to the list is as easy as typing it into the input field and clicking the "+" button.

You can also visit http://localhost:3000/work to access the Work ToDo list page, which functions similarly to the main page, enabling item management for work-related tasks.

The application includes an informative About page, accessible at http://localhost:3000/about, offering an overview of the project and its functionalities. Each page in the project is meticulously designed using EJS, ensuring a consistent and cohesive design style throughout.
